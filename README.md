---

With the YouTube Speed Memory extension, you can apply custom playback speed settings for every video and channel, and even better, you aren't restricted to just the speed settings provided in the YouTube video controls.

Choose a speed for a video, or an entire channel, and every time a matching video plays, the appropriate speed is chosen. Great for playlist where you prefer a faster playback on certain songs. Also great when there is a particular channel, like one featuring coding tutorials, where you always find yourself turning the playback speed up.

This extension is open source and licensed under the MIT license, so you can feel free to check out the source code at the extension home page or even contribute to make it better!
